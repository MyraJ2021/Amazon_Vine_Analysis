Although I was able to create the dataframes successfully, I am having connection issues when it comes to writing the dataframes to tables in RDS. I tried closing out AWS, PGAdmin, and Google Collab and reconnecting, then tried dropping the PGAdmin tables and remaking them as suggested in the challenge; but it did not work.
